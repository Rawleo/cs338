Summary: 

This game taught me how to read the contents of a file by using cat. Many files were also hidden with specific properties, so by utilizing find I could locate the path to the file that contained the password. Then things got a lot harder with files that had the password deeply embedded within it, so advanced techniques such as grep to locate a pattern in the file and different types of encryption such as base64 and rot13.
