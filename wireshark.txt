===== DAYTIME =====
1. 1 192.168.64.2 129.6.15.28 TCP 74 49000 -> 13 [SYN]
1. 2 192.6.15.28 192.168.64.2 TCP 66 13 -> 49000 [SYN, ACK]
1. 3 192.168.64.2 129.6.15.28 TCP 54 49000 -> [ACK]
2. 49000 
3. The client needs a port to route the traffic incoming from the server to the client's application 
4. 4 129.6.15.28 192.168.64.2 DAYTIME 105 DAYTIME Response
5. [SYN] - synchronize signifys the desire to establish a connection, [ACK] - acknowledge signifys the establishment of a connection. 
6. The daytime server initiated the closing of the TCP connection because it sent the first [FIN, ACK].

===== HTTP ======
1. 2 TCP Connections. 2 [FIN, ACK] packets each were sent which shows the end of the TCP handshake between the client and server.   
2. Yes: 4 192.168.64.2 172.233.221.124 HTTP 489 GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
3. Yes: 9 192.168.64.2 172.233.221.124 HTTP 451 GET /jeff-square-colorado.jpg HTTP/1.1 

Note: Used host cs338.jeffondich.com to identifty that the host address to monitor was actually 172.233.221.124

===== QUESTIONS ===== 
1. I see [PSH, ACK] instead of [SYN, ACK], is this because the server is just throwing the information at the client application to build the contents of the website? How does PSH differer than SYN?
